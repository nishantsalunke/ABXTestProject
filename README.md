# ABXClient

This is a C# application that connects to a server, fetches packets, handles missing sequences, and saves data to a file. The code uses TCP sockets to communicate with the server and process data.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET SDK**: The application is built with .NET (Core or Framework). Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed on your system.
- **Visual Studio or another C# IDE**: You can use Visual Studio or any other C#-compatible IDE for running the application.
- **Server Setup**: You need to have a server running on the specified port (`3000` in this example) to communicate with the client application. You can replace the server IP and port if you want to test it on a different machine.
